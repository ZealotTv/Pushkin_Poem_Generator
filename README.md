# Pushkin_Poem_Generator

I used collection of poems by Pushkin to train the neural network to generate text. There is also a set of weights that were obtained after 4 epochs. 
Now the neural network generates nonsense, but after several more epochs it will begin to generate more or less normal sentences.


P.S. The error was caused by a work stop, the code is working
